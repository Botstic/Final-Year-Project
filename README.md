# Final-Year-Project
A repository for all files for my final year project


The 'final year project' zip folder is the old project files as of the first submission date.

The data set is contained in individual zip files as csv files(to be able to upload them to github) and used to train and test the neural network code.


To run the code please copy all the csv files to a folder on the home folder and change the path: "data_path =" and set the location to where the current csv files are located.
Next just click run through each ipynb jupyter notebook and you can see the NN running.

I have set the number of epochs to 5 for speed, please change them to a number such as 15 for comparable results.
